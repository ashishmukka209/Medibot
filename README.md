    🩺 MediBot - Real-Time Patient Monitoring System
    Welcome to MediBot — an intelligent system that monitors real-time patient vitals, detects anomalies, generates detailed medical reports, and sends emergency alerts when critical conditions are detected. 🚑

    📜 Project Overview
    MediBot is a full-stack project built to simulate a hospital patient monitoring dashboard using AI.
    It:
    Collects patient vitals (heart rate, oxygen, temperature, blood pressure).

    Detects whether the vitals are Normal, Abnormal, or Critical.

    Generates detailed medical reports using a fine-tuned AI model.

    Sends emergency alerts instantly via Telegram if a patient's condition becomes critical.

    Displays a live dashboard (built with Streamlit) showing real-time patient information.

    🛠️ How to Run Locally
    1. Clone the Repository
    bash
    Copy
    Edit
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MediBot.git
    cd MediBot
    2. Install Requirements
    bash
    Copy
    Edit
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    (Or manually install: fastapi, uvicorn, streamlit, transformers, torch, datasets, requests)

    3. Start the Backend Server
    bash
    Copy
    Edit
    uvicorn api.medibot_server:app --reload
    Server runs at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

    4. Start the Real-Time Dashboard
    bash
    Copy
    Edit
    streamlit run dashboard/realtime_dashboard.py
    Dashboard runs at: http://localhost:8501

    5. Simulate Patient Data
    bash
    Copy
    Edit
    python scripts/real_time_monitor.py
    This will start sending random patient vitals every few seconds.

    🔒 Authentication
    All vitals POST requests require a secure Bearer Token:

    makefile
    Copy
    Edit
    Authorization: Bearer medibot_secret_token_123
    Set the token in the Streamlit sidebar when starting monitoring.

    📈 Example Output
    Vitals Monitoring:

    Heart Rate: 138 bpm

    Oxygen: 84%

    Temperature: 103.5°F

    Blood Pressure: 185/115 mmHg

    Medical Report:

    The patient has elevated blood pressure, indicating hypertension.
    The oxygen saturation levels are critically low, suggesting hypoxia.
    Immediate intervention may be necessary.

    Alert:

    🚨 Telegram message sent instantly if the patient is critical.

    ✨ What's Special
    Highlights important conditions like tachycardia, hypoxia, hypertension, and hyperthermia automatically in the report.

    Zero paid services used — built with completely free and open-source tools.

    Designed for easy expansion: Add more agents, store data in cloud, integrate speech input, etc.

    🤝 Future Improvements
    Deploy backend to AWS EC2.

    Add voice-based interaction using Google Speech-to-Text.

    Store vitals and reports securely in MongoDB/Firebase.

    Fine-tune an even more powerful AI model for better diagnosis accuracy.
